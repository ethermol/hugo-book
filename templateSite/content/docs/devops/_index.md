# Ignition
This project has multiple goals. First one is to recuperate using a workflow which is sustainable. Second one is to obtain more experience within DevOps.

## Getting Focus
Not being able to focus introduced the need to change my workflow. In order to predict where browser- and terminal-windows are located without having to look for them caused the hop from macOs to Arch-linux. Within arch we'll use predefined desktops and a dark themed tiling window manager (spectrwm). Tiles do NOT overlay (by default) so all windows on a desktop are visible at any time. The desktops are predefined which helps with locating windows without having to look for them.   

## DevOps Experience
This part of the project is meant to enhance my DevOps experience. Using a lab environment we will employ tools like Docker, CloudFormation (cfn) and TerraForm (tf) in order to implment an automated self-documenting front-end kubernetes environment. This environment will be powered by AWS graviton2 architecture (t4g, ARM) which provides more bang for the buck. A single instance K8S setup will be used as the Orchestration tool to serve and manage the container(s).
