# Introduction
Eyesight issues caused a need to change my workflow. Not being able to focus introduced the need be able to predict where things like browser- and terminal-windows are located without having to look for them. That's why I hopped from macOs to arch-linux. Within arch we'll use predefined desktops and a dark themed tiling window manager (spectrwm). Tiles do NOT overlay (by default) so all windows on a desktop are visible at any time. The desktops are predefined which helps with locating windows without having to look for them.   

## Ignite project
This project is self imposed in order to to enhance my DevOps experience using a lab environment. Using tools like Docker, CloudFormation (cfn) and TerraForm (tf) we are going to implment an automated self-documented front-end kubernetes environment. This environment will be powered by AWS graviton2 architecture (t4g, ARM) which provides more bang for the buck. K8S will be used as an Orchestration tool to serve and manage the containers.
