## About me

Recuperating from an eye disease I realized that I'll have to change my workflow significantly in order to survive within the DevOps scape. This caused the incarnation of this self imposed project called "The DevOps Society". This project will document my journey from changing my workflow till enhancing my DevOps experience with K8S, CI/CD and other automation tools needed to becoming a "certified professional DevOps" engineer.
