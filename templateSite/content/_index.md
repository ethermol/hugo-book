## Checking out Arch

Arch is a popular rolling release, security patches should be current.
Arch doesn't have an installer, install from scratch only picking the packages which are needed.
The end result is a minimalist, workflow basedi, installation providing a minimal attack surface.

Will be architected as we go so further goals or end points are unknown at this point in time.
Should give some handles to explore DevOps operations.
