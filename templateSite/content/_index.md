## About me

Recuperating from an eye disease I realized I'll have to change my workflow significantly. This caused the incarnation of this self imposed project called "The DevOps Society". This project will document the journey of my changing workflow and provide handles for enhancing DevOps experience with K8S, CI/CD and other automation tools needed to becoming a "certified professional DevOps" engineer.
