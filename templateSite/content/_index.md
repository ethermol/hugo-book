# Where abouts

## About me

Recuperating from an eye disease (choroidea hemangioom) I realized that I'll have to change my workflow significantly in order to survive within the DevOps scape. This caused the incarnation of this self imposed project called "The DevOps Society". This project will document my journey from changing my workflow all the way to enhancing my DevOps experience with K8S, CI/CD and other automation tools needed to becoming a "certified professional DevOps" engineer. 

## About the project

### Getting focus
This will document the tools used to obtain a sustainable workflow. Those comprise an Arch workstation, Spectrwm as a tilling window manager, Docker, terminal (alacritty), firefox (browser), neomutt (mail), pass/keepassxc (passwords),  AWS-cli, k3s (kubernetes), and many more mostly terminal based tools. The objective here is to be be able to locate target frames without having to look through piles of stacked windows. This gets materialized by using a tilling window manager (spectrwm for now). Tiles do NOT overlay (by default) and are grouped by predefined Desktops. All tiles on the active Desktop are visible at all times.

### Using tools
This part of the project is describes the tools used to setup this project. We will employ tools like Docker, CloudFormation (cfn) and TerraForm (tf) in order to implment an automated self-documenting front-end kubernetes environment. This environment will be powered by AWS graviton2 architecture (t4g, ARM) which provides more bang for the buck. A single instance K8S setup will be used as the Orchestration tool to serve and manage the container(s).

### Getting experienced
One of the objectives for this part of the project is to test the workflow described above. As a side effect it provides an excellent opportunity to enhance my DevOps skillset. A practical "DevOps professional certification" course will be picked as a guidline to test and practice.
