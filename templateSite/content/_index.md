# Where abouts

## About me

Recuperating from an eye disease I realized that I'll have to change my workflow significantly in order to survive within the DevOps scape. This caused the incarnation of this self imposed project called "The DevOps Society". This project will document my journey from changing my workflow till enhancing my DevOps experience with K8S, CI/CD and other automation tools needed to becoming a "certified professional DevOps" engineer. 

## About the project

Part I: will document the tools used to support my new workflow. As stated before those comprise an Arch workstation, Spectrwm as a tilling window manager, Docker, terminal (alacritty), firefox (browser), neomutt (mail), pass/keepassxc (passwords),  AWS-cli, k3s (kubernetes), and prbably many more.
Part II: will document how those tools can be implemented to support the workflow. We setup an envvironment in the cloud in order to test the new workflow. A practical "DevOps professional certification" course will be used as a guidline for the setup.
Part III: TBD, just added to show how the site could/should be extended.
